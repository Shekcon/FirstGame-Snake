# FirstGame-Snake
Snake game build in VIsual Studio 2015 using C++ on console 
This is my first game ,it have some problem with playing .
But in the furture i hope get more stuff in game like menu, save info and setting .
If U dont understand something or help me improve coding, maybe figure out some bug  just contact me on fb account https://fb.com/shekcon

+In ver 0.2 now have art snake console and menu but only for play : just press Enter to play

Control(like FPS) : a: left ; d: right ; w: up ; s: down 

Menu: like control above
 
+In ver 0.3 : remove scrollbar , add title game, add color for map and food ,snake's location when playing , now game can play more easy than previou version.

+In ver 0.4 : add more sound in game but U need find PlaySound in function ShowMenu() and Logic() change link location file.wav to dirct link of this wav in your computer
